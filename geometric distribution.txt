Negative Binomial Distribution

Formular b*(x,n,p) = .........

where:

The number of success to be observed is x
The total number of trials is n
The probability of success of 1 trial is p
The probability of failure of 1 trial is q = 1 - p

Geometric Distribution - special case of Negative Binomial Distribution - deal with the number of bernoulli trials requrired before getting a first success. (which mean the number of success is 1)

Note x = 1

Formula g(n,p) = (q ** (n-1)) * p

Example

A player's shooting rate is 70%. What is the probability the player success at his fifth shot?
n = 5
p = 0.7
q = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

--> g(n=5, p=0.7) = (0.3 ** 4) * 0.7

Exercise

What is the probability that the 1st defect is found in the 5th inspections. Known: Probability that a machine produces a defect is 1/3.

from fractions import Fraction
n = 5
p = Fraction(1,3)
# print(p)
result = ((1-p) ** (n-1)) * p
print(round(float(result), 3))

Geometric Distribution II

Exercise

What is the probability that the 1st defect is found during the first 5 inspections. Known: Probability that a machine produces a defect is 1/3.

from fractions import Fraction
p = Fraction(1,3)
n = 5

def geo(n,p):
    return ((1-p) ** (n-1)) * p

answer = sum([geo(i, p) for i in range(1, n+1)])
print(round(float(answer), 3))
